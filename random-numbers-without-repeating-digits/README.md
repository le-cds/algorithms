# Random Numbers Without Repeating Digits

The aim of these algorithms is to generate random number strings with two properties:

* The strings have a certain length $n$.
* No digit repeats more than twice consecutively.

This problem came up in the context of two-factor authentication: users are presented with a number they have to enter. Having longer consecutive runs of the same digit arguably reduces the number's readability.
